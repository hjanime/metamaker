MetaMaker
=========

MetaMaker is a simple, user friendly application for generating known-content metagenomic datasets.

Installing
==========

OS X:   MetaMaker requires a few python packages, numpy, BioPython, and matplotlib (for making plots with DataParser). To install these you need compilers though, so grab XCode from the app store or install GNU compilers.
The easiest way to install the packages are through pip. If you don't have pip installed you can install it with:

    $ sudo easy_install pip

Then install the packages with:

    $ sudo pip install biopython

Both numpy and matplotlib should be installed as dependencies of biopython, otherwise just install them in the same way as biopython!
